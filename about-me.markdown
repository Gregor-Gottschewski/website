Hi, there. I am Gregor Gottschewski, computer science student from Stuttgart, Germany. On this website I talk a bit about computers, programming, tech and much more.

I started this project to share my thoughts and experiences with you building my own compiler. The project isn't nearly finished yet, but I am working on it. If you are interested in this topic, feel free to follow me on my journey.

You can find me and my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/Gregor-Gottschewski) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregor-gottschewski-167b86329/). Let's start this funny journey! For feedback or suggestions, feel free to [contact me](mailto:gregorgott.software@yahoo.com).
